# Improving Breast Cancer Diagnostics Project

Our team is dedicated throughout this project to improve the breast cancer diagnostics leveraging machine learning capabilities provided by the latest technologies. 
Our project will have the below scope:
- Choose 3 machine learning models and evaluate thier capabilities in predicting the diagnostics.
- Investigate and engineer a set of features best to perform accuracy and optimized prediction.
- Provide a list of recommendations and action items to project stakehlders for them leveraging the solution.

> [!NOTE]
> This initiative is considered to be a research project and a prelude to a pilot project to be implemented at hospitals and cancer clinics.

## Content







This is the project for our Machine Learning project for ML Team #4
summarizes your team, your project goals, your findings, and any other risks and considerations.

Team members:
Below are our team members:
1- Omar Alfaqih - https://github.com/omaralfaqih6/

Business Case: - @OA
1- write a short paragraph to provide context and brief description of the features and the dataset.
2- Our project is to answer this business question: Which features of a breast mass are predictive of breast cancer diagnosis (malignant vs. benign)?
3- Our stakeholders are:
a. clinical doctors - Their interest in the project is knowing the exact features required to predict the cancer will increase the accuracy of diagnosis whether its malignant or benign. Which will lead to better treatment/management for the patients. 
b. Hospital Management - It will reduce the cost in diagnosing the patient. 
c. Hospital's Legal department - Avoiding the lawsuits against doctors for consequences of false diagnosis.
d. Medical Equipment Manufactors - Enabling manufacturers in building more optimized diagnostic panels for collecting the data.
e. Patients - Interested in being accurately diagnosed to avoid the unnecessary health and psychological effects of false diagnostics.
f. Ministry of Health - The accurate disgnostics will reduce the cost and the expenses paid by Public health budget.


Project Goals: @AH
Identify the features, found in the Wisconsin dataset, that are predictive of malignant breast cancer.
- explore the methods to choose the models
 and the evaluation methods at least 3 different models.
- Find the top-5 feature resposible for the predictions - SHAP mostly
- 

Your findings (Results):
- Refine the project and identify which features for their significance(top 3 or 5), and the reason & the criteria on choosing.
- List the names of the 2-3 models - SVM (Support Vector Machine) & Random Forest Model chosen out of list of 5. @SB
- List the accuracy of each model - @SB
- The choice of a model (How and why)
- Work on finding the top-5 features contributed to the predictions
- Include images and graphes/visuals

Project's Tools and 

Risks Identified & Considerations:
Dataset findings:
- Working with sample dataset
- Any features missing thaqt can be useful
- The method of acquisition the data, ease of measuring the data. 
- 
Missing Human behavior and deitary issues

Project risks including uncertainty, choosing the model, the evaluation methods, the more different model we evaluate, the better the risk management we'll follow. 
The depednency of the data on the models.

Recommendations:
- Provide a list of actionable items to be addressed by your audience, for example, for doctors.
- Based on the importance of features, highlight the features and what should be done or considered in measuring them.
