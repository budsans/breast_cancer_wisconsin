# breast_cancer_wisconsin
This is the project for our Machine Learning project for ML Team #4
summarizes your team, your project goals, your findings, and any other risks and considerations.

Team members:
Below are our team members:
1- Omar Alfaqih - https://github.com/omaralfaqih6/

Business Case:
1- write a short paragraph to provide context and brief description of the features and the dataset.

Project Goals:
Identify the features, found in the Wisconsin dataset, that are predictive of malignant breast cancer.

Your findings:
- Refine the project and identify which features for their significance(top 3 or 5), and the reason & the criteria on choosing.

Risks Identified & Considerations:
Dataset findings:
- Working with sample dataset
- Any features missing thaqt can be useful
- The method of acquisition the data, ease of measuring the data. 
- 
Missing Human behavior and deitary issues

Project risks including choosing the model, the evaluation methods, the more different model we evaluate, the better the risk management we'll follow. 
The depednency of the data on the models.

Recommendations:
- Provide a list of actionable items to be addressed by your audience, for example, for doctors.
- Based on the importance of features, highlight the features and what should be done or considered in measuring them.
